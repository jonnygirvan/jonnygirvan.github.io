                    <h2>Warehouse Materials</h2>
                    <h3>Application Background</h3>
                    <p>The materials application was a pre-existing tool used on mobile devices in warehouses. Field crews will arrive at a warehouse and provide warehouse managers with a list of materials that they need to complete their work for that day.
                        The warehouse manager is then responsible for providing the items to the crews and updating the warehouse inventory. This application was intended to streamline a previously paper-based process.</p>
                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>When the application was originally deployed, users complained that the process of adding materials to an order was too time-consuming, and they struggled with keeping track of what was already on the issuance. This led users to abandon
                        the app and reverting to their old processes, which reduced overall inventory accuracy. The product team asked for assistance in solving this issue.</p>
                    <h3>Approach Summary</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Learn about the platform stack to find out any system limitations</li>
                        <li>Interview with users to hear about their issues</li>
                        <li>Prototyped multiple variants</li>
                        <li>Created a usability study to find the best design candidate</li>
                        <li>Refined chosen prototype</li>
                        <li>Final round of usability testing to validate the prototype</li>
                        <li>Delivery to product team</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><b>The design provided to the development team, based on user feedback solved the previously evident abandonment issues.</b></p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Users of the app can now add items to an order, and view the order as a whole on one screen. The screens needed to add an item were reduced from 3 to 1, which alleviated the stress users had when trying to keep up with a customer who
                        was listing off items to them verbally.</p>
                    <p>Additional enhancements discovered through interviews and testing were provided to the product team and are slated to be worked on at a later time. These include items such as allowing the crews to submit the order before arriving
                        at the warehouse, based on the scope of their work, so the warehouse manager only has to worry about preparing the order. </p>
